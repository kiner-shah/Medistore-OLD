<h1>MEDISTORE</h1>

***MEDISTORE*** is a pharmacy store system which uses *File Handling* and *OOPS* concepts of C++ Programming Langauge. A user can either be a customer or a staff. Each type of user has only certain privileges, for example, a customer can only browse items or purchase items but **cannot** modify stock items. This project was developed not for any commercial use, but just to test the skills.
